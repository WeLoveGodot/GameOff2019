# Theme(copy from itch)

> Game Off is our annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. 
>
>This year’s  theme is LEAPS AND BOUNDS.
>
>You’re welcome to interpret the theme however you wish, but if you need some ideas to kickstart your creativity, maybe your game could:
>
>* Make your character evolve to overcome challenges
>* Add obstacles to test your hero’s ability to leap into action
>* Deduct points for anything going out of bounds
>* Duck, dip, dive, and dodge an enemy that’s changing or moving rapidly
>* Take place in the year 2020, the next leap year
>* Maybe the year 2020 will lead you to think about hindsight being 20/20, and that’ll inspire even more ideas around time travel, decision-making, or something else. 
>
>Let your imagination run wild and create a game loosely-based or inspired by that theme using whatever game engines, libraries or languages you prefer before December 1st, 13:37 PT.
>
>Good luck and have fun!
